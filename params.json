{"name":"Neddick","tagline":"Neddick: Open Source Information Discovery Platform","body":"Neddick\r\n========\r\n\r\nNeddick is an Open Source Information Discovery Platform, which shares an approach to information discovery with \r\nconsumer facing websites like [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com), [Digg](http://www.digg.com), and other aggregator \r\napplications.  Neddick makes up one component of the [Fogcutter Suite](http://code.google.com/p/fogcutter) and is \r\nbased on Groovy & Grails.   \r\n\r\nNeddick could be termed \"Reddit for the Enterprise\" but that would be oversimplifying a bit.  Neddick \r\nis intended mainly for organizational use and therefore has features that Reddit lacks, but, in turn, \r\nlacks certain things that Reddit has.  But Reddit was absolutely our inspiration for Neddick and you'll \r\nnotice the commonality almost immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy \"Neddick?\"\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWe like lighthouses, so Neddick is named after the famous Cape Neddick \"Nubble\" Lighthouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n----------\r\n\r\nRelative to Reddit, Neddick adds features like:\r\n\r\n* Channels can subscribe to RSS feeds - any \"channel\" in Neddick (roughly equivalent to a Sub-Reddit on Reddit) can link to 0 or more RSS feeds, and the channel will automatically be populated from those feeds on a scheduled basis.\r\n* Tags - Neddick supports the application of arbitrary tags to entries, and provides each user a view of the tags they have used, to enable rapid access to specific content.\r\n* Channel Filters - Filters allow you to filter your view of a channel based on criteria including: body keyword, title keyword, score, and tags.\r\n* More powerful \"sharing\" capability - Neddick supports sharing content by email, XMPP, and HTTP POST.\r\n* ActivityStrea.ms support - Neddick can HTTP POST entries to remote endpoints in [ActivityStrea.ms format](http://www.activitystrea.ms).  This is how we built our integration with [Quoddy](http://code.google.com/p/quoddy) - the Enterprise Social Network component of the Fogcutter Suite.\r\n* Channel Triggers - Triggers allow a user to specify actions to occur when Entry related events occur which match criteria which may include:  A new Entry is posted which matches a body keyword or title keyword, an Entry is voted up past a specified score threshold, or a specified tag is applied to an Entry.  \r\n* Trigger actions include sharing via email, XMPP and HTTP post, and in future releases will be extend to include sending JMS messages, launching workflows via BPM integration, and running user provided scripts.\r\n\r\nTo see Neddick in action, visit [the demo site](http://demo.fogbeam.org:8080/neddick/).
